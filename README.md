### Who I Am
As a data scientist, I specialize in transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights.  
My work bridges the gap between raw information and informed decision-making by combining analytical thinking, statistical modeling, and efficient engineering practices.

I take pride in designing robust data pipelines, automating analysis workflows, and delivering insights that matter.  
Clarity, structure, and reproducibility are at the core of everything I build.
